# Login Redirect Fix Summary

## Issue
After implementing authentication for the token generation system, users were not being automatically redirected to the token generation page after login. Instead, they were being redirected to the home page (`/`).

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `UserAuth.log_in_user/3` function in `heads_up/lib/heads_up_web/user_auth.ex`. The function was using this logic:

```elixir
def log_in_user(conn, user, params \\ %{}) do
  user_return_to = get_session(conn, :user_return_to)

  conn
  |> create_or_extend_session(user, params)
  |> redirect(to: user_return_to || signed_in_path(conn))
end
```

The problem was:
1. When users accessed the login page directly (not via redirect from a protected page), `:user_return_to` was `nil`
2. The fallback `signed_in_path(conn)` was called with a connection that didn't have the user assigned yet
3. This caused `signed_in_path` to return `/` instead of `/token`

## Solution
Modified the login redirect logic to explicitly redirect to `/token` for new logins:

```elixir
def log_in_user(conn, user, params \\ %{}) do
  user_return_to = get_session(conn, :user_return_to)

  conn
  |> create_or_extend_session(user, params)
  |> redirect(to: user_return_to || ~p"/token")
end
```

## Behavior After Fix

### Direct Login
- User visits `/users/log-in` directly
- User logs in with magic link
- **Result**: User is redirected to `/token` (token generation page)

### Redirect After Protected Page Access
- User tries to access `/token` while unauthenticated
- System redirects to `/users/log-in` and stores `/token` in `:user_return_to`
- User logs in with magic link
- **Result**: User is redirected back to `/token` (original destination)

### Login from Other Protected Pages
- User tries to access any protected page while unauthenticated
- System redirects to login and stores the original path
- User logs in
- **Result**: User is redirected back to the original protected page

## Files Modified

1. **`heads_up/lib/heads_up_web/user_auth.ex`**
   - Changed `log_in_user/3` to redirect to `/token` instead of using `signed_in_path(conn)`

2. **Test Updates**:
   - `heads_up/test/heads_up_web/controllers/user_session_controller_test.exs`
   - `heads_up/test/heads_up_web/user_auth_test.exs`
   - `heads_up/test/heads_up_web/live/user_live/confirmation_test.exs`
   - `heads_up/test/heads_up_web/live/token_live_test.exs`

## Testing
All tests updated to expect redirect to `/token` instead of `/`. Added specific tests to verify:
- Direct login redirects to token page
- Login with return_to parameter respects original destination
- All existing authentication flows work correctly

## Impact
✅ **Improved User Experience**: Users are immediately taken to the primary application feature after login  
✅ **Consistent Navigation**: Aligns with the navigation changes that prioritize token generation  
✅ **Preserved Functionality**: Return-to behavior still works for protected page access  
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved  

## Verification
- ✅ All 141 tests pass
- ✅ No compilation errors or warnings
- ✅ Direct login flow redirects to token page
- ✅ Protected page access + login flow works correctly
- ✅ Return-to functionality preserved

This fix completes the navigation improvements by ensuring users are automatically directed to the token generation page after authentication, making the workflow more intuitive and efficient.
